# Kanban Flow — Slice 1 Design

**Date:** 2026-09-14
**Status:** Current. Where this document and `cs482_workflow.md` disagree, **this document wins**. `cs482_workflow.md` is retained as the original product specification and is not being edited; the decision table in §1 names every point it supersedes.
**Scope:** The first implementation slice defined in `cs482_workflow.md` §10, plus the resolution of open specification questions that affect the slice 1 schema and route shape.

---

## 1. Decisions confirmed

These were resolved by review of `cs482_workflow.md`. The final column names what each decision supersedes in that document.

| ID | Decision | Supersedes |
|---|---|---|
| **D-01** | Plan and build **slice 1 only**. Sprints, velocity, rollover, AI reporting, GitHub inbound, and PAT issuance are slice 2. | — (§10 already scoped this) |
| **D-02** | **HTMX drives requests; Alpine.js holds pure UI state only** (modal open/closed). Web HTML routes are **separate** from the `/api/v1/*` JSON routes: the web route returns a rendered HTML fragment, the API route returns JSON, and both call the same service function. | §7, which implied the web UI consumes `/api/v1/*`; §9's undecided "Alpine.js/HTMX" |
| **D-03** | Chat notifications fire on exactly two events: **`TICKET_CREATED`** and **`TICKET_DONE`**. **No duplicate suppression** — a `DONE → IN_PROGRESS → DONE` round trip sends two cards. | Fills a gap; §6/FR-06 never listed trigger events |
| **D-04** | Every project-scoped route is keyed by **`{slug}`**, never `{project_id}`. **`slug` is immutable** — it is derived from `name` at creation and never changes, even when `name` is edited. | §7, which mixed `{slug}` and `{project_id}`; §6, which left rename behavior undefined |
| **D-05** | Sprint close **auto-creates or resolves the rollover target and moves unfinished tickets into it, but leaves that sprint in `PLANNING`**. Promotion to `ACTIVE` stays a manual OWNER action. Rationale: `committed_points` freezes at activation, so auto-activating at close would freeze the baseline against rolled-over tickets alone and permanently exclude anything added during planning, inflating every subsequent velocity reading. What ADR-005 wanted to eliminate was Jira's prompt for a *destination*; that is still eliminated. | §4 Workflow 3 step 2c; §6 Sprint rules; ADR-005's consequence column |
| **D-06** | **No `delayed_days` snapshot** in `SprintTicketHistory`. The live value on the ticket serves the board badge; the historical value survives as prose in the generated report. | Confirms §6 as written; closes the question |
| **D-07** | Report endpoints split: `POST /report/generate` is **server-side generation only** and returns `409` when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is absent. The MCP fallback reads **`GET /api/v1/sprints/{id}/report/payload`** and writes the draft back through the existing `PUT /report` with `generated_by = MCP_CLIENT`. The payload endpoint doubles as the fixture the §8 grounding test compares against. | §8's claim that the MCP path posts to `/report/generate` |
| **D-08** | GitHub inbound webhooks use a **per-project URL**: `POST /api/v1/webhooks/github/{slug}`. The signature is verified against that one project's `github_secret`. | §7's single global `/api/v1/webhooks/github` |
| **D-09** | Slice 1 runs **locally only** (`docker compose up`). Outbound chat webhooks need no public address. Deployment happens in slice 2, when the GitHub inbound webhook and the MCP client first require a public HTTPS endpoint. | Sequences §9's hosting requirement |
| **D-10** | Tooling: **uv** for dependencies, **ruff** for lint/format, **pytest**, **alembic** from the first commit, **pydantic-settings** over a `.env` file. | Fills a gap |
| **D-11** | CSRF: a **session-bound signed token in a hidden form field**, validated on every HTML route `POST`. `/api/v1/*` authenticates by Bearer PAT (slice 2) or session cookie plus an `Origin` check. | Fills a gap; CSRF was unaddressed |
| **D-12** | Sprint-related ticket columns (`sprint_id`, `rollover_count`, `delayed_days`, `first_sprint_entered_at`) and `Project.github_secret` are **not created in slice 1**. They arrive as an alembic migration in slice 2. | Sequences §6 |

## 2. Slice 1 scope

### In
- User registration and login with `name`, `email`, `password_hash`; signed session cookie.
- SQLite initialization in WAL mode with foreign keys enforced.
- Project creation; the creator becomes `OWNER` in the same transaction.
- Member management by email (add, change role, remove) — required because authorization is tested in this slice.
- Ticket creation through both the JSON API and the web modal, with atomic per-project `ticket_number` allocation.
- Ticket status transitions (needed by D-03's `TICKET_DONE` event), maintaining `completed_at` and `resolution_notes`.
- Kanban board render: four fixed columns, sanitized Markdown descriptions.
- Background chat webhook dispatch to Slack, Discord, and Teams.

### Out (slice 2)
Sprints and the sprint lifecycle, velocity, `SprintTicketHistory`, rollover, AI sprint reports, GitHub inbound webhooks, `ApiToken` / PAT issuance, the MCP server, deployment, and rate limiting.

## 3. Module layout

```
app/
  main.py            FastAPI app, lifespan, router mounting
  config.py          pydantic-settings, reads .env
  db.py              engine, session dependency, per-connection PRAGMA listener
  models.py          SQLModel tables
  schemas.py         request/response models
  auth.py            bcrypt hashing, signed session cookie, CSRF token,
                     current_user / require_member / require_owner dependencies
  services.py        create_ticket(), set_status() — shared by web and API routers
  notifications.py   dispatcher plus the three payload formatters
  rendering.py       markdown-it-py (HTML disabled) -> bleach allow-list, exposed as a Jinja filter
  routers/
    api_auth.py  api_projects.py  api_tickets.py  web.py
  templates/
    base.html  login.html  register.html  dashboard.html  board.html
    partials/ticket_card.html  partials/ticket_modal.html
  static/
alembic/
tests/
docker-compose.yml
```

**Why `services.py` exists.** D-02 gives ticket creation two entry points. `ticket_number` allocation and notification scheduling must exist in exactly one place, so the routers do authentication and serialization only and both delegate to the same function. This is the one shared-logic module in the slice; adding more service modules before there is a second consumer would be premature.

**Why the three formatters live inside `notifications.py`.** Each is a function returning one dict. Splitting them across files costs more to navigate than it saves.

---

## 4. Schema

Four tables. Field lists are complete for slice 1; D-12 columns are absent by design.

### User
`id` UUID PK · `name` VARCHAR(50) · `email` VARCHAR(255) unique, stored lowercased · `password_hash` VARCHAR(255) bcrypt · `created_at` TIMESTAMP UTC

Deleting a user is unsupported. All timestamps across the schema are UTC-aware.

### Project
`id` UUID PK · `name` VARCHAR(100) · `slug` VARCHAR(50) globally unique, **immutable** · `webhook_type` ENUM(`NONE`,`TEAMS`,`SLACK`,`DISCORD`) default `NONE` · `webhook_url` VARCHAR(500) nullable · `next_ticket_number` INTEGER default 1 · `created_at` TIMESTAMP

- `slug` is derived from `name` at creation: lowercased, non-alphanumerics collapsed to `-`, trimmed to 50 characters. A collision returns `409` naming the conflicting slug; no suffix is appended silently.
- Editing `name` later does not change `slug` (D-04).
- `webhook_url` must be present and `https` whenever `webhook_type != NONE`, else `422`.

### ProjectMember
`id` UUID PK · `project_id` UUID FK · `user_id` UUID FK · `role` ENUM(`OWNER`,`MEMBER`) · `joined_at` TIMESTAMP

- Composite unique on `(project_id, user_id)`.
- The creator is inserted as `OWNER` in the project-creation transaction.
- A project must retain at least one `OWNER`; removing or demoting the last one returns `409`.

### Ticket
`id` UUID PK · `ticket_number` INTEGER, per-project sequential · `project_id` UUID FK · `title` VARCHAR(255) non-empty after trimming · `description` TEXT Markdown, max 20,000 chars · `type` ENUM(`STORY`,`BUG`,`DEMO_REQUEST`,`TASK`) · `status` ENUM(`BACKLOG`,`SELECTED`,`IN_PROGRESS`,`DONE`) · `priority` ENUM(`LOW`,`MEDIUM`,`HIGH`,`URGENT`) default `MEDIUM` · `story_points` INTEGER nullable, constrained to `{1,2,3,5,8,13}` · `creator_id` UUID FK · `assignee_id` UUID FK nullable · `resolution_notes` TEXT nullable · `completed_at` TIMESTAMP nullable · `meta` JSON · `created_at` TIMESTAMP immutable

- Status transitions are **unrestricted**; the only validation is enum membership.
- `completed_at` is set when `status` becomes `DONE` and cleared when it moves away. `resolution_notes` is **not** cleared on that move — it is the author's text, and losing it on an accidental status change is worse than leaving a stale note that is editable.
- `assignee_id` must reference a `ProjectMember` of the same project, else `422`.
- `meta` is rejected with `422` if it is not a JSON object, nests deeper than 3 levels, or serializes above 8 KB.
- `description` is stored raw and sanitized at render time only, so the Markdown source stays editable.
- Creation does **not** accept `sprint_id`; sprints do not exist in this slice.

---

## 5. Route contract

### Web routes (HTML)
- `GET /login`, `GET /register` — authentication views.
- `GET /dashboard` — the caller's project list and a project creation form.
- `GET /projects/{slug}` — the board: four columns of rendered ticket cards, plus the `[+ New Ticket]` modal.
- `POST /projects/{slug}/tickets` — modal submission. Returns **one rendered `ticket_card.html` fragment**, which HTMX inserts with `hx-swap="afterbegin"` into the `BACKLOG` column. No full page reload.
- `POST /projects/{slug}/tickets/{ticket_number}/status` — board dropdown. Returns the re-rendered card fragment.

All five `POST` routes require the CSRF hidden field (D-11).

### API routes (JSON, `/api/v1`)
- `POST /auth/register` — `409` on duplicate email. `POST /auth/login` — `401` with identical message and timing for unknown email and wrong password. `POST /auth/logout`.
- `GET /projects` · `POST /projects` (`409` on slug collision) · `GET /projects/{slug}` including the caller's role · `PATCH /projects/{slug}` (name, webhook settings; **OWNER**) · `DELETE /projects/{slug}` (**OWNER**, requires `?confirm=<slug>`).
- `GET /projects/{slug}/members` · `POST /projects/{slug}/members` by email (**OWNER**; `404` unknown user, `409` already a member) · `PATCH /projects/{slug}/members/{user_id}` (**OWNER**; `409` if it would remove the last owner) · `DELETE /projects/{slug}/members/{user_id}` (**OWNER**; their tickets keep `assignee_id = NULL`).
- `GET /projects/{slug}/tickets` — board query, filters `status`, `assignee_id`, `type`, `priority`; `limit` default 50 max 200, plus `cursor`.
- `GET /tickets/{id}` · `POST /tickets` · `PATCH /tickets/{id}` · `PATCH /tickets/{id}/status` (accepts optional `resolution_notes`) · `DELETE /tickets/{id}` (**OWNER**).

### Error conventions
`401` unauthenticated · `403` authenticated but insufficient role · `404` absent **or** the caller is not a project member · `409` state conflict · `422` validation failure.

## 6. Authentication, CSRF, authorization

- **Session:** an `itsdangerous`-signed cookie carrying `user_id`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and `Secure` when not running locally.
- **CSRF:** a token bound to the session, emitted into every HTML form as a hidden field and validated by a dependency on `routers/web.py`. JSON routes are exempt because slice 2 authenticates them by Bearer PAT; until then a cookie-authenticated JSON request is additionally checked against `Origin`.
- **Authorization:** `require_member(slug)` and `require_owner(slug)` resolve the project and the caller's `ProjectMember` row. A non-member receives `404` on reads and `403` on writes, so project existence never leaks. Slice 1 permissions follow `cs482_workflow.md` §6 restricted to the entities that exist here: every member may create, edit, and transition tickets; only an `OWNER` may edit project settings, manage membership, delete the project, or delete a ticket.

---

## 7. `ticket_number` allocation and SQLite configuration

A SQLAlchemy connection event applies `journal_mode=WAL`, `synchronous=NORMAL`, `foreign_keys=ON`, and `busy_timeout=5000` to every connection. `foreign_keys` defaults to OFF in SQLite; without this the foreign keys in §4 are decorative.

Allocation happens in the same transaction as the ticket insert:

```sql
UPDATE project SET next_ticket_number = next_ticket_number + 1
WHERE id = :project_id RETURNING next_ticket_number - 1
```

`MAX(...) + 1` is rejected because two concurrent readers can observe the same maximum. The `UPDATE` takes a write lock that serializes competing creations, and `busy_timeout` absorbs the wait. A failed insert rolls the counter back with it, preserving the no-gaps property.

The application runs under a single Uvicorn worker. SQLite permits one writer; additional workers produce `database is locked` under concurrent writes. Database-touching routes are declared `def`, not `async def`, so the synchronous session runs in FastAPI's threadpool rather than blocking the event loop.

---

## 8. Notification dispatch

```python
def schedule(tasks: BackgroundTasks, project: Project, event: str, ticket: Ticket) -> None
def dispatch(webhook_type: str, webhook_url: str, payload: dict) -> None
```

- `schedule` freezes everything the delivery needs into a **plain dict** at scheduling time. No ORM object crosses into the background task, so a closed session can never trigger a lazy load there, and `dispatch` has no database dependency at all.
- Formatters are a `webhook_type -> callable` mapping producing Slack Block Kit, Discord Embeds, or Teams Adaptive Cards. The transport is one identical `POST` of JSON in all three cases.
- Delivery uses a synchronous `httpx` client with a 5-second per-attempt timeout and three retries at 1s, 2s, and 4s. Final failure writes one `WARNING` naming `project_id` and `ticket_number`.
- `BackgroundTasks` run after the response is sent, therefore after commit. There is no code path by which a chat outage can reverse a ticket mutation.
- Events are `TICKET_CREATED` and `TICKET_DONE` (D-03). Delivery is at-most-once; failures are visible only in logs, and the slice ships no delivery-status UI.

---

## 9. Markdown rendering

`markdown-it-py` with raw HTML disabled, then `bleach` with an allow-list, exposed as a Jinja filter and applied to `description` at render time. Never applied on write.

---

## 10. Validation

Tests run against a **file-backed** SQLite database in `tmp_path`. An in-memory database reproduces neither WAL, nor foreign key enforcement, nor lock contention — precisely the three things this slice needs to demonstrate.

| Test | Covers | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| 50 concurrent ticket creations in one project | V-1, FR-12 | Zero `database is locked`; 50 distinct consecutive numbers; p95 write under 50 ms |
| Ticket creation with `webhook_url` pointed at a black-hole endpoint | V-4, FR-06 | `201` returned under 500 ms; ticket persisted; exactly one `WARNING` after retries |
| (non-member, MEMBER, OWNER) × every mutating endpoint | V-8, FR-10 | Every cell matches the permission matrix |
| Description containing `<script>` and `<img onerror=...>`, rendered on the board | V-9, FR-11 | Rendered as inert text; no execution |
| Duplicate-email registration; successful login | FR-01 | `409`; session cookie issued |
| `meta` above 8 KB; `meta` nested 4 levels | FR-03 | `422` in both cases |
| Board query over a seeded 5,000-ticket project | V-2 | Record the measured p95; target under 20 ms |

V-2's figure is recorded rather than assumed, and replaces the unmeasured read-latency claim in `cs482_workflow.md` §2.

---

## 11. Deferred, with the trigger for revisiting

| Deferred | Revisit when |
|---|---|
| `sprint_id`, `rollover_count`, `delayed_days`, `first_sprint_entered_at`, `github_secret` columns | Slice 2 begins; added by alembic migration |
| Public deployment and HTTPS | The GitHub inbound webhook or the MCP client needs a reachable address |
| Rate limiting (`slowapi`) | The service is publicly reachable |
| Notification duplicate suppression | Round-trip status changes actually produce noise a team complains about |
| `delayed_days` history snapshot | A screen exists that would display delay trend |
